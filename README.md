## Overview

The **Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)** is a .NET Core MVC web application prototype designed to streamline the monthly claim submission and approval process for independent contract lecturers within educational institutions. This project addresses the administrative challenges of manual claim processing by providing a digital, structured, and user-friendly platform.

This repository represents **Part 1** of the project, focusing exclusively on **planning, design, and the creation of a non-functional UI prototype.**

## üéØ Project Status: Phase 1 Complete

This is a **non-functional prototype**. The application features a complete, navigable user interface with all planned screens and components. However, it does not yet contain business logic, data persistence, or user authentication.
- ‚úÖ **Complete:** All views (screens) are built and connected.
- ‚úÖ **Navigable:** Full UI flow from dashboard to details pages.
- ‚úÖ **Simulated:** Buttons and forms appear functional but do not alter data.
- ‚è≥ **Pending:** Database integration and core functionality are scheduled for Part 2.

## ‚ú® Features (Demonstrated in UI)

*   **Dashboard:** An overview with summary statistics and quick actions.
*   **User Management:** Pages to list, view, create, and edit system users (Lecturers, Coordinators, Managers).
*   **Role Management:** Interface for managing user roles and permissions.
*   **Claim Submission:** A form for submitting new contract claims (simulated).
*   **Claim Management:** Pages to view, edit, and track the status of all claims.
*   **Approval Process:** A dedicated interface for managers to review and process claims.
*   **Document Management:** Functionality to upload and manage supporting documents for claims.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** ASP.NET Core 6.0 (MVC)
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript
*   **IDE:** Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
*   **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## üó∫Ô∏è System Design

The application is built on a well-structured database schema. The core entities and their relationships are shown in the UML Class Diagram below, forming the foundation for the application's data model.



**Key Entities:**
*   `User` - Stores all system users.
*   `Role` - Defines user permissions (Lecturer, Coordinator, Manager).
*   `Claim` - The central entity for claim details.
*   `SupportingDocument` - Manages files uploaded to support claims.
*   `Approval` - Tracks the verification and approval process.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
*   A code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RibaOrearabetse/PROG6212-POE-Part-1.git
    cd PROG6212-POE-Part-1
    ```

2.  **Open the Solution:**
    *   Open the `Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS).sln` file in Visual Studio.

3.  **Build and Run:**
    *   In Visual Studio, press `Ctrl+F5` to run without debugging (IIS Express).
    *   Alternatively, use the command line:
        ```bash
        dotnet build
        dotnet run --project "Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)"
        ```

4.  **View the Application:**
    *   Navigate to the URL shown in the console (typically `https://localhost:7000` or `http://localhost:5000`).
    *   **Important:** Use the navigation menu to explore all features. Remember, this is a prototype‚Äîforms will not submit data, and buttons will only simulate actions.
